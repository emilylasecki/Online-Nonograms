        <h2> Why I Made This Website</h2>
        <p> &emsp; I was first introduced to nonograms through Pokémon Picross in early 2016. I played the game infrequently and one day forgot about it entirely. In the spring of 2024, I decided to pick up the game again, remembering how I enjoyed it. I quickly noticed a connection between nonograms and combinatorics, a sector of mathematics I was briefly introduced to at the time. I began formulating a question I could write some code to answer, and I finished writing my first python program in August of 2024 counting how many n x n grids are possible while increasing the number of colors on the grid. I discovered from this that ignoring the concept of clues and focusing on the individual cells of nonograms with this idea of color is a way to represent the Worpitzky numbers.
         <br> <br>  &emsp;  I took a break for a few months to work on other projects and decided to create some puzzles so I have the freedom to play from my phone, and can easily introduce others to the concept. 
        <br>  <br>  &emsp;  The original question I set out to answer remains unknown to me, but I plan to study popular solving algorithms and answer it with a future project. 
        </p>
          <h2> Future Nonogram Projects</h2>
        <p> &emsp; Nonograms are a fantastic application for computer science and mathematics alike. I hope to prove that grids that appear symmetric but aren't symmetric cannot have a unique solution, as these parameters always introduce a switching component to the grid. I also want to understand the relation between row clues and column clues – specifically how they impact uniqueness and solvability. 
       <br>  <br>   &emsp;  Other modifications of nonograms with potential for research questions are triddlers – a nonogram game with an additional dimension on a hexagon shaped grid, Mega picross – a standard grid where 2 neighboring rows of clues can be merged to form mega clues, and murals – a cluster of several nonogram games that comprised create one big image.
            </p>
        <h2> Other Nonogram Resources</h2>
        <p> I've found WebPBN to be an excellent archive of solving techniques, ..., and the communities general perspective on these puzzles.
            <br> Griddlers, although covered in adds, has a plethoral of puzzles and is the source that introduced me to triddlers. The website has several other types of puzzles that may be of interest.
        <br> My previous repository <a href="https://github.com/emilylasecki/Nonogram-Counting">here</a> contains some documentation on my specific research question and the relevant background information.
        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> &emsp; My name's Emily and, at the time of writing, I'm an undergrad computer science student at Oakland University. Aside from coding and playing nonograms, I enjoy hiking, water skiing, traveling with my family, and playing with my dog.</p>
