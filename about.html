        <h1> About</h1> <br>
        <h2> Why I Made This Website</h2>
        <p> &emsp; I was first introduced to nonograms through Pokémon Picross in early 2016. I played the game infrequently and one day forgot about it entirely. In the spring of 2024, I was reminded of the game and decided to try it out again. I quickly noticed a connection between nonograms and combinatorics, an area of mathematics I was briefly introduced to at the time. I began formulating a question I could write some code to answer, and I finished writing my first python program in August of 2024 counting how many n x n grids are possible while increasing the number of colors on the grid. I discovered from this that ignoring the concept of clues and focusing on the individual cells of nonograms with this idea of color is a way to represent the Worpitzky numbers.
         <br> <br>  &emsp;  I took a break for a few months to work on other projects and decided to create some puzzles so I have the freedom to play from my phone, and can easily introduce others to the concept. This website is the result of that.
        <br>  <br>  &emsp;  The original question I set out to answer remains unknown to me, but I plan to study popular solving algorithms and answer it with a future project. 
        </p>
          <h2> Future Nonogram Projects</h2>
        <p> &emsp; Nonograms are a fantastic application for computer science and mathematics alike. I plan on expanding on my previous project to establish how many colors need to exist on a grid for the grid to have only unique solutions. I also hope to prove that grids that appear symmetric but aren't symmetric cannot have a unique solution, as these parameters always introduce a switching component to the grid.
       <br>  <br>   &emsp;  Other modifications of nonograms with potential for research questions are triddlers – a nonogram game with an additional dimension on a hexagon shaped grid, Mega picross – a standard grid where 2 neighboring rows of clues can be merged to form mega clues, and murals – a cluster of several nonogram games that comprised create one big image.

        <h2> Other Nonogram Resources</h2>
        <p>  &emsp; • I've found <a href="https://webpbn.com/">WebPBN</a> to be an excellent archive of nonogram information and it has the bonus of the communities perspective on these puzzles. In some forum entries there are discussions of stronger solving techniques not explored on this site.
            <br><br> &emsp;  • <a href="https://www.griddlers.net/home">Griddlers.net</a>, although covered in adds, has a plethoral of puzzles and is the source that introduced me to triddlers. The website has several other types of puzzles that may be of interest.
        <br> <br> &emsp; •  <a href="https://github.com/emilylasecki/Nonogram-Counting">My previous repository</a> contains some documentation on my specific research question and the relevant background information.
        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> &emsp; My name's Emily and, at the time of writing, I'm an undergrad computer science student at Oakland University. Aside from coding and playing nonograms, I enjoy hiking, water skiing, traveling with my family, and playing with my dog. If you're interested in this project or any of my other GitHub repositories, feel free to reach out!</p>
