# Online Nonograms

Visit the live site <a href="https://online-nonograms.netlify.app/">here</a> to play 10 10x10 nonogram puzzles.

## What is a nonogram?

A nonogram is a logic puzzle on a grid, where based on “clues” in the form of numbers at the top of columns and the left of rows, the player must use a set of procedures to find what cells should be filled in with a specific color. Below is an example of a nonogram of a fish, where only one color is used.
